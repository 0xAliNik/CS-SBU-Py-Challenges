# Final Project

Various ML Methods Implementation From Scratch using Python

<br>

Project Structure
 
 - \<method folder>
     - model.py
     - main.ipynb

<br>

Method Implementation:

- Linear Regression
    - Dynamic learning rate         
    - Multi-feature
- Logistic Regression
    - Logit Function
- Support Vector Machine
    - Various kernels


<br>
* Each method must be a python Class with their attributes and methods
<br>
* Available External Library: numpy


<br>

Main Procedure:

    1. Import & Show Dataset
    2. [Data Preprocess] (e.g. scale features)
    3. Spliting Dataset
    4. Train
    5. Infrenece
    6. Visualization & Metrics
    7. Compare with other libraries (e.g. sklearn)
